Train the Trainer: How to Become an Effective Workshop Facilitator - Elke Emmers

The objective of this session is to help participants become skilled trainers by providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge to create and deliver engaging and effective workshops. By the end of this workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of how people learn, how to transition from presentation to teaching, how to tailor workshops to specific audiences, and how to use themselves as the most important instructional tool.

[Formative assessment and inclusive language](https://github.com/DCC-training-lab/DCC-spring-training-ttt) - Mateusz Kuzak & Lieke de Boer

During this session, participants learn practical tips and tricks that will allow them to keep track of their learners progress and understanding during teaching practice. They will learn about how to design formative assessments and use inclusive language to avoid their learners dropping off. At the end of the session, some time will be devoted to implementing the tips and tricks into the participants' teaching material

Hands-on with DCC Training Lab GitHub organisation - Stephanie van de Sandt, Meron Vermaas & Mateusz Kuzak

During this session, we will show participants the GitHub organisation where we collect training materials developed for Spring Days Training.
